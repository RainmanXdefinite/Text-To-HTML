# Text-To-HTML
The source code for the original versions of Text To HTML. Please use Text To HTML - CORE now. Link to download: https://monasoft.itch.io/text-to-html/

# Should I use the Original or CORE?
Before this repo, you could still use the original without any risk, but CORE was still strongly recommended. Now that this repo exists with all of the source code for all the vers, using Text To HTML over Text To HTML - CORE is not really... safe, or practical. CORE is recommended because of more features. I dont have any plans to release CORE source code.
